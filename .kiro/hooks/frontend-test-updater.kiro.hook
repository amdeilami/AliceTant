Determine if corresponding tests exist in the appropriate test directory\n3. If tests exist, update them to reflect the changes\n4. If no tests exist, create a few reasonable tests that cover the main functionality\n5. Focus on testing key user interactions, component rendering, and critical logic - DO NOT write exhaustive tests for every edge case\n6. Use Vitest and React Testing Library as specified in the tech stack\n7. Place tests in a `__tests__` directory adjacent to the source file or in a `tests` directory at the appropriate level\n\nKeep tests simple, focused, and maintainable. We want quality over quantity."
