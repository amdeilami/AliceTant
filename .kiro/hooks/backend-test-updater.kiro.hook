If no tests exist (e.g., new feature or model), create a few focused, essential tests - DO NOT write exhaustive tests for every detail, just 1-3 key tests\n4. Place any new test files in backend/AliceTant/tests/ following the naming convention test_[module_name]_unit.py or test_[module_name]_properties.py\n5. Keep tests concise and focused on the most important functionality\n\nRemember: We want minimal, targeted test coverage - not comprehensive testing of every edge case."
