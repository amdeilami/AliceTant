# Product Overview

AliceTant is a lightweight online appointment-booking system designed for small and personal businesses—such as hair stylists, tutors, or independent artists—who need a simple way to manage their schedule without enterprise-level complexity.

# Roles and Targets

The platform supports two roles:

Provider: the business owner who defines availability and manages appointment slots.

Customer: a client who views available time slots and books appointments.

The system prioritizes strong data consistency—ensuring that no time slot can be double-booked—over raw performance. It is intended for small-scale usage (up to 10,000 customers for each provider).
