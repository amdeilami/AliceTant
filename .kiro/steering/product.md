# Roles and Targets

The platform supports two roles:
The Platform is based on three main concepts:

Business: an entity that provides a service to customers.

Provider: the business owner who defines availability and manages appointment slots for that business.

Customer: a client who views available time slots presented by businesses and books appointments.
